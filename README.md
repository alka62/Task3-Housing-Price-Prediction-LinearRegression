# 🏡 Housing Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project implements **Simple** and **Multiple Linear Regression** using Scikit-learn to predict housing prices based on key features like area, bedrooms, bathrooms, etc., using a **comprehensive dataset with 13 features**.

---

## 📌 Objective

- Understand and apply Linear Regression models (simple & multiple)
- Evaluate model performance using MAE, MSE, and R² score
- Interpret regression coefficients
- Visualize predicted vs actual values using Matplotlib

## 📁 Dataset

Dataset Name: **Housing Price Prediction - A Comprehensive Dataset for Price Forecasting**  
📊 Total Features: **13**

This dataset includes features such as:
- `area`: Size of the house in square feet  
- `bedrooms`: Number of bedrooms  
- `bathrooms`: Number of bathrooms  
- `stories`: Number of floors  
- `mainroad`: Whether the house is on the main road  
- `guestroom`: Guest room availability  
- `basement`, `hotwaterheating`, `airconditioning`  
- `parking`: Parking capacity  
- `furnishingstatus`, `prefarea`, etc.  
- `price`: Target variable
